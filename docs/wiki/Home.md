# Multiverse.jl — Wiki (English)

Welcome to the Multiverse.jl documentation wiki. Multiverse.jl is a Julia-based simulation engine for generating hierarchical multiverse systems using Effective Field Theory principles. It creates parent universes with randomized cosmological properties and generates multiple generations of child universes produced by quantum field fluctuations.

This wiki contains:
- Installation instructions
- Quickstart examples
- Configuration and API references
- Example notebooks and scripts
- Contribution and development guidelines
- FAQ and troubleshooting

Purpose
- Provide clear, practical guidance to researchers, developers, and students who want to simulate hierarchical universes with Multiverse.jl.
- Document common workflows and configuration options.
- Explain basic theory and assumptions behind the generator in accessible terms.

Navigation
- Installation — how to add the package to your Julia environment.
- Quickstart — run a minimal simulation end-to-end.
- Configuration — options for controlling generation and randomness.
- API — high‑level reference of main types and functions.
- Examples — ready-to-run experiments and visualizations.
- Contributing — how to help improve Multiverse.jl.

If you have suggestions for this wiki or want additional examples, please open an issue or a pull request on the repository.
